## 🔥 **Project Overview**
This project leverages **XGBoost**, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm, to predict house prices with an impressive **92% accuracy**. The model is built using a comprehensive **data preprocessing pipeline** and advanced **hyperparameter optimization**, making it highly robust and generalizable. The focus is on predictive accuracy, interpretability, and usability.

## 📊 **Key Features**
- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - 🔄 Applied **transformers** for custom feature transformations.
  - 🧹 Used **SimpleImputer** to handle missing data effectively.
  - 📉 Implemented **Yeo-Johnson transformation** to normalize skewed features.
  - 🔠 Encoded categorical features for machine learning compatibility.

- **Modeling:**
  - 🚀 Trained using **XGBoost**, known for its speed and high performance.
  - ⚙️ Optimized hyperparameters with **GridSearchCV** for maximum performance.

- **Evaluation:**
  - 📈 Achieved **92% accuracy** with **R² Score**.
  - 🧮 Evaluated using **MSE** (Mean Squared Error) and **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error).

- **Visualization:**
  - 📊 Plotted **feature importance** to show how different variables impact house prices.
  - 🖼️ Visualized data distributions and model performance for clarity.

## 🚀 **Technologies Used**
- **Python**
- **XGBoost**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** (for beautiful visualizations)
